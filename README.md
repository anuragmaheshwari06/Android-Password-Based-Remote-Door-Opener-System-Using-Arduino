# ANDROID-PASSWORD-BASED-REMOTE-DOOR-OPENER-SYSTEM-USING-ARDUINO
The aim of the project is to create a remote password based door opener system through an android application. Where the system tends to make a secure door opening mechanism such that the door only unlocks when the password entered is correct through an android application. As soon as commands are sent through the android device a Bluetooth receiver is used to receive those commands. These commands are then sent to the 8051 microcontroller. The microcontroller processes these commands and then tallies the password to check its correctness. If the right password is encountered it sends command to open the door. The main objective is to create a password based opening door which works on Microprocessor 8051 and the door only responds when the password is correct this way it can be more secure and protective.
